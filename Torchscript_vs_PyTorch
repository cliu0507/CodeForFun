Why python is slow:
Python is great for putting your quantitative ideas clearly and succinctly, but interior loops in Python have always been slow due to the absence of type information. Pythonâ€™s duck typing system really comes to bite when this absence of typing creates unnecessary code and indirection, leading to relatively slow inner loops.

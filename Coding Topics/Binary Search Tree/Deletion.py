Deletion NODE in BST

1) Node to be deleted is leaf: Simply remove from the tree.

              50                            50
           /     \         delete(20)      /   \
          30      70       --------->    30     70 
         /  \    /  \                     \    /  \ 
       20   40  60   80                   40  60   80
2) Node to be deleted has only one child: Copy the child to the node and delete the child

              50                            50
           /     \         delete(30)      /   \
          30      70       --------->    40     70 
            \    /  \                          /  \ 
            40  60   80                       60   80
3) Node to be deleted has two children: Find inorder successor of the node. 
Copy contents of the inorder successor to the node and delete the inorder successor. Note that inorder predecessor can also be used.

              50                            60
           /     \         delete(50)      /   \
          40      70       --------->    40    70 
                 /  \                            \ 
                60   80                           80
The important thing to note is, inorder successor is needed only when right child is not empty. 
In this particular case, inorder successor can be obtained by finding the minimum value in right child of the node.


class Node:
 
    # Constructor to create a new node
    def __init__(self, key):
        self.key = key

    # return the (unchanged) node pointer
    return node

# with minum key value found in that tree. Note that the

def minValueNode( node):
    current = node
 
    # loop down to find the leftmost leaf
    while(current.left is not None):
        current = current.left 
 
    return current

# delete the key and returns the new root
def deleteNode(root, key):
 
    # Base Case
    if root is None:
        return root

    if key < root.key:
        root.left = deleteNode(root.left, key)
 
    # If the kye to be delete is greater than the root's key
    # then it lies in right subtree
    elif(key > root.key):
        root.right = deleteNode(root.right, key)
 
    # If key is same as root's key, then this is the node
    # to be deleted
    else:
         
        # Node with only one child or no child
        if root.left is None :
            temp = root.right 
            root = None
            return temp 
             
        elif root.right is None :
            temp = root.left 
            root = None
            return temp
 
        # Node with two children: Get the inorder successor
        # (smallest in the right subtree)
        temp = minValueNode(root.right)
 
        # Copy the inorder successor's content to this node
        root.key = temp.key
 
        # Delete the inorder successor
        root.right = deleteNode(root.right , temp.key)
 
 
    return root
